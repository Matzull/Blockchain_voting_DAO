    "You should foresee a specific contract state in which the voting process is not open but that allows

    Possible solution: Create another array with proposals that are archived:
    Put signaling and unapproved proposals in the archive so new voting can begin, the archive can be kept for
    a determined amount of time for voters to take their money back, after that the archive is also deleted for saving space
    
    Extra thoughts: If I'm worried about DOS by creation of a large amount of voters, I should be worried about DOS by
    creation of a large amount of proposals as well (especially signaling). The deletion of signaling proposals can be handled
    by using pops of the signalingProposals array. This solution is a version of resumable function where there is no
    saving index, only pop is continously used.
